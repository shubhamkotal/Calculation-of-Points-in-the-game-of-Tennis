# Calculation-of-Points-in-the-game-of-Tennis
Tennis is a popular professional sport, uses a manual coding of point
outcomes. The purpose of this project was to find a better approach for
the calculation of the score for each player. The data was majorly
described in 3 categories: winner, forced error and unforced error.
As per the game rules, my project was to find the best scoring model via
Machine Learning algorithms.
The Model involved data understanding and evaluation for accuracy
checking, evaluation, and testing.
The Model used was XG Boost.

Jupyter notebook is been shared.
